An sysfs beeper driver for the Radiodetection DVC2 fpga.

The beeper can have its frequency set, and sound for a given duration.  The 
resolution of the duration is 10ms, the duration limit is 2.5 seconds.

The beeper will sound, and you cannot interrupt the beeper once it is
sounding.

The beeper has a sysfs interface

beep         duration_ms  modalias     name         subsystem
driver       frequency    muted        power        uevent

Key attributes:
- muted: if non zero the beep will not sound
- frequency: frequency in Hz (limit 8192Hz)
- duration_ms: duration in ms (limit 2500ms)
- beep: A write to beep will cause the beeper to sound.
        As a convenience feature, a write of two decimal numbers (a frequency
        followed by duration in ms) will cause the beeper to sound at the
        given frequency for the given duration.


device tree bindings
--------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: "rdfpgabeep"
- reg: the I2C address

Optional properties:
- muted: if present the beeper is muted by default
- frequency: default frequency (default 440Hz)
- duration_ms: default duration_ms (default 1000)

	joystick_left: rdfpgabeep@2b {
		compatible = "rdfpgabeep";
		reg = <0x2b>;
		frequency = <440>;
		duration_ms = <1000>;
		muted;
		status = "okay";
